This repo contains notes, diagrams, and other mostly non-binary file
materials related to my Buddhist Dharma study.

Also refer to my Google NotebookLM [[https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/274540c8-8583-49b7-9e9e-141d18d3988a][Buddhist_Dhamma_Pali_to_English]] where I
have uploaded ~.txt~ and ~.pdf~ versions of the Pali Tipitaka so I can
ask NotebookLM about the Theravada Pali Canon.
